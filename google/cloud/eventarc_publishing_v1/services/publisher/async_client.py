    An event provider is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) system or

    A third-party event provider is an event provider from outside
    of Google.
    A partner is a third-party event provider that is integrated
    with Eventarc.
    A subscriber is a GCP customer interested in receiving events.
    Channel is a first-class Eventarc resource that is created and

    represents a subscriber's intent to receive events from an event
    provider. A Channel is associated with exactly one event
    provider.

    ChannelConnection is a first-class Eventarc resource that is
    created and managed by the partner in their GCP project. A
    ChannelConnection represents a connection between a partner and
    a subscriber's Channel. A ChannelConnection has a one-to-one
    mapping with a Channel.
